We are here to make sure that vision is a sound one, and that the product developed will have a future on the market once it is ready to be released. Therefore, we manage our projects and products well before any real engineering takes place and stay with the product during each phase of its lifecycle. During development our team doing the hands-on work truly understands the product architecture and the plans and goals that the app needs to fulfill, which helps them do more meaningful and higher-quality work. This also helps in setting up the product and the team for future scaling."    },
